 what is config driven UI?
 we see the example
 in delhi we have different offer
 in banglore we have different offer 
 and in other plase we have no offer 
 and all theoffer is shown in crousel like in swiggy 
 sp all the offer works we call it config driven UI

 so we can say that in different place we have different data
  so this happend from back end
